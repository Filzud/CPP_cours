See |version4.txt|, |version5.txt|, |version6.txt|, |version7.txt| and
|version8.txt| for differences between Vim versions.

You can find an overview of the most important changes (according to Martin
Tournoij) on this site: https://www.arp242.net/vimlog/

							*Sven-Guckes*
Vim version 9.0 is dedicated to Sven Guckes, who passed away in February 2022
when the release was being prepared.  Sven was a long time supporter of Vim.
He registered the vim.org domain and created the first Vim website.  We will
remember him!

==============================================================================
NEW FEATURES						*new-9*

First an overview of the more interesting new features.  A comprehensive list
is below.


Vim9 script ~
							*new-vim-script-9*
The Vim script language has been changed step by step over many years,
preserving backwards compatibility.  Several choices made in the early days
got in the way of making it work better.  At the same time, Vim script is
being used much more often, since there are so many plugins being used.

Vim9 script provides a syntax that is much more similar to other languages.
In other words: "less weird".  Compiled functions are introduced which allow
for a large speed improvement.  You can expect around ten times faster
execution, or even more.  The price to pay is that Vim9 script is not
backwards compatible.  But don't worry, you can still use your old scripts,
the new script language is added, it does not replace the legacy script.

Information about Vim9 script can be found in the |Vim9| help file.


Command line completion in a popup menu ~
							*new-popup-compl*
Before there was the 'wildmenu' option, which uses the space of one line above
the statusline to show matches.  Only a few matches fit there.

Now a popup menu can be used by setting "wildoptions' to "pum".  This allows
for showing many more matches.  This requires redrawing more of the display,
but since computers are fast enough that is not a problem.


Updated colorschemes ~
							*new-colorschemes-9*
Colorschemes from https://github.com/vim/colorschemes have been included.
They were made to work consistently across many types of terminals.  Although
generally an improvement, a lot of personal preference is involved.  You can
always get the old version if you prefer it, look here:
https://github.com/vim/colorschemes/blob/master/legacy_colors/
